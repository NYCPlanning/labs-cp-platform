    <h4>Product Overview</h4>
    <p>
      The Capital Projects Explorer’s primary purpose is to provide a common operational picture to capital planners and budget staff across City agencies, which can in turn minimize conflicts among different agencies’ capital projects, maximize opportunities for coordinated capital investment planning and funding alignment, and provide a starting point for integrated neighborhood-based planning.
    </p>

    <h4>Limitations and Disclaimers</h4>
    <p>
      The Capital Projects Explorer is only as good as the source data it aggregates.  Currently, there is no data standard for capital project mapping and agencies are not required to map their capital projects; therefore, the Capital Projects Explorer makes some assumptions to aggregate and normalize the data into one data table.
      As a result of these limitations and inconsistencies, the Capital Projects Explorer is not an analysis tool, it does not report any metrics, and the data should not be used for quantitative analyses - it is <strong>built for planning coordination purposes only</strong>.
